# Azure CLI
## Why Azure CLI Learn
Creating resources through azure console (or) Azure UI (or) Azure Portal, it's very simple. But Azure CLI should learn because through Azure portal only 1 VM will be created at a time. When we have to perform **Quick Actions**, as a DevOps Eng your handling lot of projects.
For Ex: We need to check how many VM's are running for a particular project (or) AKS clusters so every time log in Azure portal and checking so it's take time.
**Automation** : Need to create AKS+VNET+File Storage
Ex: For XYZ company so it takes 1hr time to create configuration.So again you got same request has same configuration creation then we can use some commands using CLI so everytime we cannot spend 1hr to create configuration. Just create one time and then store the script it in Git Repo so that time will be reduced.

## Why should we use CLI
1. Quick Actions
2. Automation
3. Reducing Errors
